# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`).
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
